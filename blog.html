        <h2>Post Saturday March 1st, 2025</h2>
            <p>
                So I guess this is my first blog post. I think there are several reasons I'm doing this. The first is that Sophie is not home this weekend so I've had a lot of downtime. I'm also avoiding doing work (oops). This is also one of the original reasons I made a wesbite. I initially thought I was going to have some really well-put-together blog going, but that's unrealistic at this stage. Another reason I'm doing this is really I want a way to passively connect with people that I love who are far away without the distraction that is regular social media. Maybe a final reason is that I want to have a cool record of the things that go on in my life, in the style of a webpage from 2003 (lol). <br>

                This will be very unserious, but as it is public, I will keep it quite tame. I plan to tell stories and make banal observations. Perhaps it's unprofessional to post this in the same place as other more math-realted things, but it is my website and I'll be careful about what exactly I decide to post.
